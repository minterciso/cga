# Introduction

In here you'll find the actuall source code that was used to examine and find the solutions for the DCT in a 2 dimenssional CA via GA. The paper regarding this solution can be found [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5949850](here).

Since the code is pretty old (circa 2011), and wasn't really touched a lot since then, you may find some different results. This is expected and to be updated both here, and on my [https://github.com/minterciso/cuCGA](CUDA port) of the same GA.

Please understand as well that it's not really optimized to execute **fast**, this will also be addressed if I have some free time.

If you have any questions, bugs, etc, please feel free to contact me.
